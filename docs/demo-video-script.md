**[Click: Sleep Log card]**

> "Each log type shows the conditions it targets and how many questions it contains. Let's assign the Sleep Log."

**[Select frequency: Daily, Click: Assign Task]**

**[Click: View Details on a CBT Thought Record entry]**

> "Clicking into an entry shows the full submission. For this CBT Thought Record, we can see the situation the client described, their automatic negative thought, the cognitive distortion they identified, and the alternative thought they came up with."

**[Scroll to metrics section]**

> "The metrics section shows quantitative data with visual indicators — here we see their belief ratings and emotional intensity, which is valuable for tracking progress over time."

**[Click: Start Log Entry on Mood Diary]**

> "When they start a log, they get a guided form with all the right fields — dropdowns for structured responses, text areas for narrative, and sliders for rating scales."

**[Fill out form briefly]**

**[Click: Submit Log]**
